      This chilling bit of New England Gothic shows that, three decades
      after *Nude Descending a Staircase*, Kennedy was still wrestling with the
      justice of death in a godless world. In the same volume, however, he also
      included an elegy for the great poet J.V. Cunningham, unusual only in that
      it is written in heroic couplets as a form of tribute to Cunningham’s
      epigrammatic formalism.


      In 2002’s *The Lords of Misrule* saw Kennedy remained in a more traditional elegiac mood in his “Jimmy Harlow,” but he also wrote comic elegies. In “Allan Ginsberg” Kennedy returns to the headless iambic tetrameter of “Little Elegy” and mourns a dead poet with the voice we most associate with X.J. Kennedy:

      Herrick condenses Martial to four lines of headless tetrameter. Herrick’s
      brevity, meter and focus on the life of the departed, all skillfully
      echoed by Kennedy, reflect the humanist-influenced poetry of English
      gravestones of his era.


      All three poems are moving, but bleak. They address the Earth or earth, not a deity who offers eternal life. Kennedy builds upon Herrick’s setting and theme, but is more expansive. By so doing, the inherent inadequacy of his plea is clearer—there is *no way* an orbiting Earth can, in fact, “trip up death.”


      As in “Nothing in Heaven Functions as It Ought,” a breakdown in meter reflects a message about a turn in thinking. Kennedy’s “Little Elegy” skillfully imitates Herrick’s headless tetrameter—*until* it breaks down in the last line as the poem fails to console. This final line has seven syllables like the others, but it starts with two stately iambs, and then concludes with this unexpected and awkward amphibrach: “trip up Death.” Roughness in rhythm again signals that a sleek and consoling conclusion just is not possible.


      In the same book Kennedy addresses the same themes of “Little Elegy” in a more ambitious and ironic fashion. His haunting poem (pun intended), “At the Stoplight by the Paupers’ Graves,” captures the pathos of dead young people who never had a chance, but goes on to weigh the moral implications of our inability to cope with the sadness of their deaths, and so many deaths:
