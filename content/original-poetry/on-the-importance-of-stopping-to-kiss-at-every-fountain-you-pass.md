title: On the Importance of Stopping to Kiss at Every Fountain You Pass
---





At
the threshold of senility,

Past
the failing of virility,

When
the memory of flaming youth

Fights
to dull the saw-toothed truth

That
the reservoir of lovers’ tokens,

Of
their symbols, soft, unspoken

Is
by now forever fixed and really frozen,

You
will wish that you had chosen

To
create a lovers’ jargon;

That
you’d stopped to kiss at every fountain.
