title: "The Admiral: Villanelle"

He walks with stately, measured steps\
Atop the pine sealed, polished deck\
Beneath two gleaming epaulets.



The many shipmen stand impressed:\
His princely gait, his manly neck.\
He walks with stately, measured steps.



He chose the waves and not the steppes:\
Across the seven seas he’ll trek\
Beneath two gleaming epaulets.



He chose. He chose, he’s now distressed.\
He fears no surf, he fears no wreck,\
He walks with stately, measure steps.



He left his father’s fishing nets,\
With ache for home he’s now bedecked,\
Beneath two gleaming epaulets.



Beneath the man lay his regrets\
Above the sea where he’s a speck\
He walks with stately, measured steps\
Beneath two gleaming epaulets.
