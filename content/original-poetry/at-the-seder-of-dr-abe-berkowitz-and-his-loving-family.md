title: At the Seder of Dr. Abe Berkowitz and His Loving Family
---
At the Berkowitz home, on 14 Nisan,\
A menagerie gathered for seder.\
Left to right, on my word, on the satin divan,\
Sat Mubarak, Ralph Nader, a satyr.



Abe recounted the plagues, frogs and hail, the first born,\
With the zeal of a bee after pollen,\
And Mubarak replied, not a little forlorn,“I lament how the mighty have fallen.”



“Ye were mighty, at least,” someone plaintively said\
(You are right, gentle reader – it’s Nader).\
-- “So much longer the fall, when by fate I was sped\
From the pyramid’s point to my nadir.”



“Not by fate but by God!” Mrs. Berkowitz flushed\
All the talking and chomping were suddenly hushed\
(You’ll soon find, gentle reader, the rhythm impaired --\
For the sake of transcription I rhythm foreswear.\
Thus she bellowed --)



“Look on my charoset, ye mighty, and despair!”



Mubarak ran off like a hare.



Then the satyr perked up, by her outburst aroused,\
And he lustfully bleated his praises.\
Dr. Berkowitz saw, understood, and then doused\
The half goat’s inappropriate blazes



With a strong Chad Gadya, looking straight in his eyes,\
Slowing down every time at the moment\
When the cat eats the goat (who in consequence dies),\
That two zuz bought the satyr’s opponent.



So the satyr slunk off, taking care not to kiss\
The mezuzah his ancestors feared.\
While Ralph Nader crept out, and his absence was missed\
Not at all when Elijah appeared.



This incredible night when we all sat reclined\
I have faithfully, briefly described.\
I was there and I drank four complete cups of wine\
Plus the four which our fathers prescribed.
