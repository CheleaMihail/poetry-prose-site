How I wish I could retire

To a cozy English shire – 

Nothing taller than a spire – 

With my echoes and my lyre

And roast mutton on the fire.

And sing songs of love and warring

In iambic verse that’s soaring

While the guard dog guards me, snoring,

Enigmatically restoring

Life to life a little boring.
