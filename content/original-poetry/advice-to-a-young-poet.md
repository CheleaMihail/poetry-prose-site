title: To a Young Poet
---





Never
trust self-styled sages

Who
extract their daily wages 

By
promoting old-new cages

In
their millions of pages. 

 

“Don’t
you jump without preparing,”

You
will hear these penguins squeak,

While
they’ve spent their whole lives staring

At
the jump pit, never daring:

Intellectually
chic

But
embarrassingly meek. 

 

Poet!
Spring into the inkwell,

Don’t
you mind the blue-black splash. 

Swim
for life upon the inkswell 

In
your momentary flash. 

 

Write,
erase, write more, efface 

The
difference between time and place,

Revise
the plot, cross out and blot. 

One
day your smudged hands will have caught

A
bird of paradise, and then 

You
will have earned your plumaged pen.
