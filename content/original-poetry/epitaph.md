"Economic with the truth," your remaining friends
insist,

While the others, with your lies, in transgressing you persist.

To aggrandize reputation was your secret, ardent goal,

But you've met with condemnation, and you've dug yourself a hole

Out of which your reputation never will crawl out and rise --

You engraved the dour inscription, that begins and ends “*Here Lies*.”
