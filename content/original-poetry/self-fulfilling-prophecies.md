Reverentially
she frowns

While
she reads the coffee grounds

That
like rivers trace our fate

(or
stain the cup). At any rate,

She
says the meaning is provisional

And
would be strengthened with additional

Readings
of the grounds.

I
invite her to another round.

 

We
talk more. Then she mentions that her Mom

Used
to peer into her palm,

Trace
the lines, the bumps, the carvings,

And
then prophecy Prince Charming.

I
feign skepticism first,

But
I put my hand in yours.

 

What’s
your zodiac? she wonders.

I
don’t know, do you? She numbers

Them,
from Capricorn to Taurus.

Palm
in palm we step outdoors,

Constellation
of two stars,

To
look above and then infer

If
I am compatible with her.

Hand
in hand these questions we pursued

While
the coffee brewed and brewed and brewed.
