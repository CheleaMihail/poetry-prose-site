title: Father and Son
---
From the head of the children’s table the son looked at his dad,\
Hands open, beaming, causing the table to laugh. He was glad\
He would also one day think important thoughts, and wondered what they’d be.\
Then he turned to entertain his tablemates, ages seven, six, and three.\
The elegant host, in between anecdotes, turned to look at his son,\
And strangely wondered what he used to think about when young.
