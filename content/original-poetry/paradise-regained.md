title: Paradise Regained
---
Have you contacted the agency
That books trips to the Aegean Sea?
Nine to five they man the phones,
Coaxing you in blessed tones
“Treat yourself to something nice,
Rediscover paradise.”

This to me seemed like a venture
Worthy of a small adventure
So I sailed and paid their price
To rediscover paradise.

Sparkling blues and fragrant whites,
Old museums and olive, humid nights,
And only waves for friends.
There, I heard the Aegean Sea’s advice --
I sailed for home, and rediscovered paradise.
