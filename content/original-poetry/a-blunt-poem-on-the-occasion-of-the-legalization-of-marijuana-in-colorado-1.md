title: A Blunt Poem, On the Occasion of the Legalization of Marijuana in Colorado
---
```
I was smoking marijuana 
Across the border, in Tijuana, 
Where the grass — first among flora 
And the dealers among fauna.

I stood smoking marijuana, 
In that humid, hazy sauna, 
Clad in sandals and fedora, 
While I waited for nirvana.

I sat smoking marijuana 
And I counted the iguanas 
As I wondered why the Torah 
Made no mention of Madonna.

At the lengthening of shadows, 
Having smoked my marijuana 
Hungry as a desperado, 
I consumed ten avocados.

To be honest, I felt hollow 
Smoking reefer in Tijuana. 
So I shipped ten avocados 
To my flat in Colorado

And discovered--holy moly! 
I had just made guacamole. 
Tijuana marijuana – 
I don’t think I'll ever wanna.
```
