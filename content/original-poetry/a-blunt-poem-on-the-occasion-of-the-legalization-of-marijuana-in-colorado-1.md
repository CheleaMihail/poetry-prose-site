I was smoking marijuana 

Across the border, in Tijuana, 

Where the grass â€” first among flora 

And the dealers among fauna.

I stood smoking marijuana, 

In that humid, hazy sauna, 

Clad in sandals and fedora, 

While I waited for nirvana.

I sat smoking marijuana 


And I counted the iguanas 


As I wondered why the Torah 


Made no mention of Madonna.

At the lengthening of shadows, 


Having smoked my marijuana 


Hungry as a desperado, 


I consumed ten avocados.

To be honest, I felt hollow 


Smoking reefer in Tijuana. 


So I shipped ten avocados 


To my flat in Colorado

And discovered--holy moly! 


I had just made guacamole.
