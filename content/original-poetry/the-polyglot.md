Polyglot

Ladies and gentlemen!



I present to you The Polyglot!

Meet the man who knew a lot

Of ways to say “je t’aime.”

His “I love you”s by the Thames,

And “Uhibbuk”s by the Nile,

Like “Ti amo” by the Tiber

Met abashed, believing smiles

(Every woman is the same).

Not by one was he beguiled,

Each one’s hot words tasted mild,

Smoky, damp logs to his flame.



After dizzying world travels,

Ties established and unraveled,

By the ancient Congo River,

Sat the Polyglot in winter.



She approached him from behind

(That’s the fate of all mankind)

When she said it with cool ease

In his mother’s Congolese.
