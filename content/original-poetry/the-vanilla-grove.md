title: The Vanilla Grove
---
In the depths of Tiktu Island by a little inlet grows

An exotic and resplendent, rich and green vanilla grove

That invites you, that excites you, that entices and delights you

With its sweet pulsating fragrance, with the crackling underfoot

Of vanilla pods just fallen. Rouse yourself, come on, and put

Aside your strict adherence to the pallid world of prose.

Follow me, tonight, my life, to the green vanilla grove.
