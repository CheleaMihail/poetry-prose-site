title: First Drafter

Here’s a classic dilettante:

All he wanted was to vaunt

Of the beauty of his raft.

We agreed it rather daft

For it wanted for a plank

When he pushed off from the bank —

And in consequence it sank.

 

Here’s a fitting epitaph:

“Always happy with the draft.

Never thought to fix his craft.”
