True, her hands were slightly mannish,

And her close relations, clannish

And her apple cheeks had vanished

Like her front two teeth…Now I’m banished

From our bedroom to the sofa – 

A domestic, grim Golgotha – 

There awaiting crucifixion

Then a brutal, forced eviction

For my criminal conviction

When I told her: “it’s no fiction

That your hands are slightly mannish,

And your close relations…”
