title: Warum
---
In the darkest hour of the night
He repeats his father’s sacred rite,


Pecks his sleepy wife and fixes his comb,


Dismisses fatigue and struts from his home.

He clears his throat and yells into the night,
The darkness presses in and he calls out to the light,
He yells again, he crows until he’s won
The daily duel with the sun.

His cry sustains a pitch of morning beauty.
Ennobled by his sense of duty,
He proudly earns his daily bread
And yells away his daily dread

Before the dark and pressing question WHY,
That the sun might rise without his cry.
