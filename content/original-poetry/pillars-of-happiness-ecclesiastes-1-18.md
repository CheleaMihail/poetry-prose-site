title: Pillars of Happiness (Ecclesiastes 1:18)
---





If a
man increaseth sorrow 

In
proportion to his knowledge,

What
a fool he is to borrow

Heaps
of dough to go to college,

Sit
in libraries til sunrise,

Cram
new terms until the fun dies

Watching
seconds ticking clockwise

Through
insouciant trust fund eyes. 

 

Her:
“Honey, look at that white column!

It’s
a blue-blood, top to bottom,

Fluted,
dignified, and solemn,

Not
a Pilsner…whaddya call ‘em?”

 

Him:
“That’s a plain, banal pilaster

Made
of brittle, crumbly plaster:

Imitation
alabaster,

A
conceptual disaster.”

 

Do
you think they’re happy? Ask her.
