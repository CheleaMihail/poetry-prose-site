title: Some Jewish Questions Will Never Be Solved
order: 1

“Since you’re
contending, if an ox gores the torso

The neighbor’s owed
payment for damage incurred

Then it must follow,
how much the more so

When the goring is
fatal, or no one’s deterred.”

 

Outside the window, a
harsh snowy layer

Has covered the oxen,
the neighbor, the field.

Pools of blood
seeping, heedless of prayer,

Young cattle
slaughtered, soldier dead on his shield. 

 

Inside the *cheder*,
the boys are debating

Some points that their
grandfathers left unresolved. 

Forever debating,
while the oxen die waiting:

Some Jewish questions will
never be solved.

\*\**

A *cheder* is a religious school for Jewish boys

Laws related to the goring ox are given in Exodus, Chapter 21. Their interpretation and disputation in the Talmud, the essential compendium of Jewish thought, form a classic part of religious education.
