With narrowed eyes and gritted teeth

The rowers felt the boat beneath

Them buoyant like a laurel wreath

And sliced the waters with their oars,

Veterans of a hundred wars

Betwixt their ivied school and yours.

 

The race is won, the glass reflects

Them coolly lounging on the decks.

Cloudless eyes and manly necks,

While the river plashed and flowed

Pouring out its liquid ode

To men who’ll be by Charon rowed.
