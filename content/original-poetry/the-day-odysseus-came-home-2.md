title: The Day Odysseus Came Home (#2)

The bow’s bent tight, he plucks the string,

The swallow sings, the music spreads

To a mosquito’s hum, and now it’s dead --

The bowstring’s eloquent reaction

To its forcible contraction

In Odysseus’s hand.

Every gesture timed and planned,

He considers all his arrows,

All his eager, jumping sparrows,

Slowly reaches for the first,

While the suitors cry commands,

He calmly aims; the feast is cursed;

The sparrows sing;

The arrows sting.
