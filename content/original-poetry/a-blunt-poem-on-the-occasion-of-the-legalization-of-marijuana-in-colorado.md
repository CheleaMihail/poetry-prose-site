title: Danse Macabre

Epigraph: There’s none who dies.\
I was there. I saw them rise. 



This night the fiddle creaks, and the flute\
Reflects the owl’s plaintive hoot\
When the call to moonlit dancing's spread\
O’er the osseous silence of the dead.



By the gravestone something whispers.\
It’s alive! — A flash of whiskers\
Of a frightened cemetery mouse\
Who this night darts from his house.



Now we hear the first bell chime,\
Chime, chime, chime, chime, chime…\
On the echoing twelfth time\
Skeletons sit up and climb



Into the dancehall of the night,\
All shades of chalk and pearl and white.\
The marauder, child, pope and king\
Dance together, dance and swing



On jerky bones that click and clatter,\
Shaking skulls that grin and chatter —\
Imitations of maracas\
In the swaying danse macabre.



Now the rooster crows his first,\
Dancers hurriedly disperse,\
Climbing down into their beds,\
To give weary bones some rest.



Epitaph: There’s none who dies.\
I was there. I saw them rise.
