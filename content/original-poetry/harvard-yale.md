Harvard men are born to rule


The alumni of that safety school

From the city that's a haven

For the great unwashed, unshaven

Masses with decidedly plebeian tastes.



Sons of Eli, spare no haste,

Give in, go home!

You are second best in Rome. 

Or maybe first in Gaul. 

Whatever. On the football field you'll fall.
