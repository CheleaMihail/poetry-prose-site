title: Burning Desire

The crumpled paper crumbles into ash;\
The envelope is licked by thorough flames\
Until the addresses, until the names\
Themselves turn into one long sooty dash.



If I were young again I'd have believed\
A missive from a mistress was received.\
I've lived enough of life to know it meant\
A letter that was written wasn't sent.
