title: YOU SAY YOU WANT A REVOLUTION (or Ecclesiastes 1:9)
---





Once tradition stood as
sentry,

Unconditionally barring
entry

To the portals of the
gentry,

 

So the people breached
the portals,

Smashed the portals,
smashed the mortals

That stood guard over the
portals,

 

And displaced the ancient
idols

And effaced the ancient
titles —

Titles, idols, to the
gentry being vital.

 

After wanton desecration

And relentless
condemnation

Leaders issued
proclamations

 

That plebeians must have
sentries

To protect them from the
gentry

Who, duplicitous, seek
entry,

 

And they gave the people
titles

(With the license to be
idle) —

An accommodated people
being vital.

 

Thus the uprising
evolved.

Manifestos thus
dissolved.

Revolutions — they
revolve.
