title: The Day Odysseus Came Home
---





The
day Odysseus came home

To
a Telemachus as old

As
the Odysseus the day

He
held Penelope and told

Her
-- I am sailing to the plains

Of
ancient Priam’s fortressed Troy.

You
will be young when I come home

With
tales of glory for our boy –

 

He
considered all the time had swept

Into
the sea, and wept.
