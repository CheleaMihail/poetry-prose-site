In his Origin of Species
Charles Darwin demonstrated
That an organism’s feces,
Feather, antlers subtly weighted
Will equip it for survival;
Will equip it for survival
And will hasten the arrival
Of succeeding generations,
And preserve the chance mutations
That promote their genes’ election
Into natural selection.

At her jeans I stared enraptured,
By her curves my will was captured,
And I thought of procreation
As a means of recreation.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
“Have a whiskey? Take the tumbler,
You’re so pretty, what’s your number?”

So I asked her and she answered,
As I hungrily looked pantsward:

“Six-one-seven, four-two-seven,
Thirty-seven thirty-seven.
But delay your celebration:
That’s my number’s permutation.”

Friends: this digital mutation
Helped forestall our procreation --
Seems ill-natured evolution
Can withstand my elocution,
And my gene pool’s days are numbered.
Darwin smiled as he slumbered.
