I cast a wish to sit with Goethe’s Faust

And ask him if the sale was worth the price,

To buckle up my cuirass for the joust

And charge but once at Lancelot – or twice;

 

To stand unmoving like a pillar when

Attila’s dusty horde will gallop at us,

To sit in council with free Roman men

And recollect the deeds of Cincinnatus;

 

To walk with Abraham before the Lord

And learn from him the art of fatherhood,

To hear the clang of hammer on the sword –

The first, when blacksmiths learned that bronze was good.

 

I cast a wish and deeply dipped my quill.

What life won’t give, the cursive letters will.
