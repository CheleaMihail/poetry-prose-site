title: Divine Struggles

At the banquet of the gods\
They pledge their fealty to him.\
Through greedy gullets (lightning rods)\
The currant liqueurs swim.



Today his grapes are ripe and sweet;\
To rites and romps the god invites us.\
Over diffidence and virgins (oh how neat!)\
Reigns mighty Dionysus.



Tomorrow, chastened, he will rise,\
His spirit crushed, its hollowness resounding,\
His temple, desecrated, pounding,\
His agony fermented.\
From husky moans we must surmise\
That until dusk he’ll be tormented.



I wonder if it’s really so,\
The tomorrow hereunto described.\
I hope it is, for then my woe\
Is equal to a god’s. My friends: I have imbibed.
