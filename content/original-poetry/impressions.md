The willowy dancer was softly approaching the barre.

A well-painted harlot was dropping some francs in a jar.

Three natural savages danced in a round hand in hand.

A boat party’s pleasure crew sipped on pastis as they tanned.

 

The pilgrims step into the countryside graveyard in Aix

They all doff their caps, leave a rose, stand around, pay respects.

Apart, on a hill, sits a painter and captures the scene.

A round yellow sun and some rough tufts of grass, very green.
