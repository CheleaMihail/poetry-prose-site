title: In the Rhythm of a Waltz
---





ONE
two three, orchestra strikes as the glistening marble

Reflects
two-three chandeliers’ glamorous sparkle

And
One floating couple’s divine sweeping grace

As
they One two three surely with hopes to retrace

The
forgotten and swept away steps of the waltz

They
had Won two-three times. When the orchestra halts,

Though
the revelry stills, still, their reverie fills

Their
soft glistening eyes with their waltz.
