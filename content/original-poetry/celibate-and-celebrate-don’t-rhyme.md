title: Celibate and Celebrate Don’t Rhyme
---





I
am writing to promote the ancient rites of Bacchanalia

That
the Puritans and Quakers have together watered down.

They
have stripped young Dionysus of his laurel-wreathed regalia

And
have made him out to be a drunken, wanton red-nosed clown,

 

As
if he, in middle age, were lusting flesh and spilling drink.

No!
The god is young, his cheeks flare red, his flesh is fresh and he spills ink!

To
every thing there is a season –

Can’t
you see that that’s the reason

Why
it’s clownish dissipation

When
it’s practiced by the old

But
succumbing to temptation

For
the young and beautiful and bold?

 

Life
is short. Go find a mate:

Celibate
and celebrate

Don’t
rhyme.

Crush
grapes, spill seed, spill rhyme, 

Spill
time.
