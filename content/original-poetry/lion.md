title: Lion

The
lion limps ahead, his crown a ragged mess

Of thorns and mane and blood, duress

A lion only can withstand still waiting for him.

The vultures, drops above, are waiting for him --

Why not? He'll make for proud, majestic
carrion. 

I limp majestic, proud, and carry on,

My mane, with winter frosted. 

I will be limping still when the vultures drop, exhausted.
