title: After the Wedding
---





From the
feast hall, dim and vacant,

Where the plates are piled high,

Where celebratory raiment,

Soaked in wine, is left to dry;

Where the wedding programs settled

(As did toppled-over chairs)

To the ground with pockmarks freckled;

Where the cleaning-girl despairs;

 

You’ll infer a
celebration

For a bride and for a groom,

You’ll see proofs of their elation

In this mirrored, gilded room.

But I see little relevance

In this second-hand tableau:

From the dried-up bits of cheese below

From the brassy chandeliers above

Nothing will you learn of love.
