title: Israel

At night, the parchment burned. Above the roar\
The letters soared back to their source and turned\
Into a field of desert flowers, red as flame,\
The scattered letters gathered into names.



We were the landâ€™s before the land was ours,\
Before the dew first settled on the stones\
Our fathers consecrated with their bones,\
And morning knew the names of many flowers.
