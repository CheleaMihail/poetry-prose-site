title: The Sailor
---
I set my watch to the humming of the stars\
And dance the tango to the booming waves.\
I own two things: a cutlass and some scars\
I purchased from my company of knaves.



My eyes – the color of the sea.\
My mind is natural and free.\
My skin – the color of the mast\
And taut like sails held fast.



Dark rum and women I’ve enjoyed\
To the final drop\
And then refilled my leather flask\
From the trusty oaken cask.\
How often have I poured? Don’t ask.



I’m fully full at age nineteen.\
I don’t feel much, a little spleen.\
My life attracts uncivil strife.\
I’ve grown unused to civil life.–\
But if it’s destined to be short\
At least I won’t have died in port.
