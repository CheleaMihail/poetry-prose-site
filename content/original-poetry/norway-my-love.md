She and I,
we’ll fight for our fill

Of each other. Give us some *sild*

And a jar of sweet preserves

To build and strengthen our reserves

Before we two envelop into one

Beneath the roving midnight sun.

 

The fjords grow warm,
the glacier breaks.

We’ll carve our memories with our lips.

We’ll drift across the hundred thousand lakes

On the memory of wooden Viking ships,

 

That drive
us north and back into the night,

The refuge of the trolls, the province of the light

Of aurora borealis, or maybe it’s our light,

The light of loving in the night.











\*\*\*\*\*\**

Give me Bergen, Tromsø, and Christiania!

*Ja vi elsker dette landet*!
