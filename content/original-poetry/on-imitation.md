title: On Imitation
---





I
am writing a novella

While
I glug a glass of Stella

Just
like Ernest Hemingway.

No,
my sentences don’t stray

From
the manly, lean, declarative,

As
they punch the dusty narrative

With
Madeira, fishing, and the bulls,

With
uprootedness that pulls

A
man from place to place.

 

It
isn't bad, so on I plod. Except my face

Is
wrought from his image,

And
his from the image of God.
