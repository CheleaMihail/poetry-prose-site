The Provençal provincial clatters in his clogs,

Daily whittles knotty wood and nightly counts his hogs.

Madame is stirring with her spoon, making bouillabaisse,

Above her solemn, smiling, Mary full of grace. 

 

My friend, he has no patience for the romance of the plebes.

He showed his girl the high life in sparkling Cap D’Antibes.

The trip –a sacrilegious romp, an everlasting hit. 

The moral of this story is: live life as you see fit.
