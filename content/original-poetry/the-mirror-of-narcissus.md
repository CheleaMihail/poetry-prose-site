title: The Mirror of Narcissus
---
Narcissus kneels and blows his kisses.\
The kisses blown reflect Narcissus’\
One belief that there is none\
Who can believe as one believes in one.\
He draws his lips, the river’s lip\
Invites his kiss, he starts to tip,\
He almost laps with tip of lips\
His pal’s reflected tip of lips.



He slips

Kiss, kiss

Finis.
