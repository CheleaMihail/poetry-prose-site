title: A Time to Scatter Stones
---

The ripples race apart, the echo of the *smack*
Of stone on water blows me back
To simple rhymes,
To silent times,
To a child by the water
Whose preoccupying bother
Isn’t that the ripples one day stop,
Or that every stone must drop –
But how to make the loudest *plop*.
