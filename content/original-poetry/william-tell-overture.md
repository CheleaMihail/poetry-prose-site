title: William Tell Overture

We are one mile in,

Here she comes, flash
of rust

Clods of earth, clouds
of dust,

Streaking past on the
rail,

Granite flanks,
sweeping tail. 

 

Now the first violin

Hears the hooves,
strikes the beat

Of the feet, and the
heat

Of the bows grows
insane,

Ripping hair from the
mare,

Winning fame,

Rippling mane.
