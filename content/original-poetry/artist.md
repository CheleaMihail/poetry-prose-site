Paint me a river,
A river of paint
That, oily, quivers.
Paint and acquaint
Me with rivers
Of boyhood, of pain
That grow full with the rain
Of the painterâ€™s best years.
What can he fear,
Who knows rivers and years,
Who knows well that both tend
To the oceans, that both end
Just the same,
Just outside the 

frame?
