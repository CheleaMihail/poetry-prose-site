One
was moody and ill-tempered and his shoelaces undone,

He’d
convulse when he would sneeze and he would wheeze when he would run,

And
the other – pleasant, gracious, with a pocket square fresh pressed,

Rowed
regattas, helped the homeless, passed her each and every test,

And
despite these overt differences I’ve emphasized, my friends,

She
awoke one sunny day, and chose “the other” in the end.
