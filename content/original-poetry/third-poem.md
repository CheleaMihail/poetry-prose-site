title: Third poem
---

Gazing at the sky, all cloud-strewn  
A child wonders, *Where’s my moon?*

Child cries a river like a monsoon;  
Wails and wails, *Where’s my moon?*

Tucked in bed, snug as a cocoon,  
Child coos gently, *Where’s my moon?*

Child wakes at sunup, fresh as June  
But worries still, *Where’s my moon?*

Child nibbles fruit like a little raccoon;  
Frets between bites, *Where’s my moon?*

Child even watches a favorite cartoon.  
But young mind wanders: *Where’s my moon?*

Like a broken record stuck on one tune,  
Child keeps asking, *Where’s my moon?*

Child pretends all afternoon  
And quizzes a wizard, *Where’s my moon?*

Child swims long and wrinkles like a prune;  
Floats the question, *Where’s my moon?*

Dinosaur twisted from a green balloon.  
Pops! Gone forever. *Like my moon?*

Child eats ice cream from a silver spoon.  
The scoop a reminder: *Where’s my moon?*

Child rolls in the tub like a silly loon.  
Splashing, asking, *Where’s my moon?*

Child sees the sunset from a little room,  
and begs once more: *Where’s my moon?*

Mama promises, *Soon, dear, soon.*  
And sure enough: *There’s my moon!*
