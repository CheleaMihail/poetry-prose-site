title: 6 Haikus

1) **A rejected proposal**

I said: “Lips! Open

And kiss me.” They, mockingly:

“Til death do us part.”

2)  **Antiquity**

Socrates, we're told,

Would play with play dough when young,

With Plato when old.

3) **Academia**

Statistics mastered

by Masters in Statistics;


doctored by Doctors.

 

4) **Universal Grammar**

Grammar fiend tells wife:

Shortest sentence is "I do."

Wife thinks: life sentence.

 

5. **Carpenters' Tools**

The old carpentress

Gets hammered and nailed well by

The old carpenter.

 

6)  **Royal Dating Service**

If you’re a black queen

Seeking interracial
mate

May I suggest chess?
