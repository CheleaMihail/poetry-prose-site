title: The Palimpsest
---





One hears “bravo” and “wow”

At the Concertgebouw.

The conductor in rapture

Has practically fractured

His entrusted, encrusted baton.



My, the percussionist’s brawn!

Raising mallet and mallet

He smashes and splashes the palette

And covers the painting

Of his ancestor dreamer

Who struck with a femur

Of the lion he slugged

A stone that he lugged

To his cave.

I sat thinking there, glum:

*Civilization: as thin as the skin of a drum.*
