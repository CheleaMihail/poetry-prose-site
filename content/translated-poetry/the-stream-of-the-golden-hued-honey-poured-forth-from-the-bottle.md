The stream of the golden hued honey poured forth from the bottle\
So viscously, slowly, the housewife had time to remark:\
-- Here, in joyless Crimea, where we have been set down by fate,\
We don’t miss what’s behind us, -- and over her shoulder she glanced.

Dionysian rites everywhere, as if watchmen and dogs\
Were the world’s only creatures, -- you walk, you don’t meet anyone.\
Like a ponderous barrel, the days, placid, roll on and on.\
Far away in the hut there are voices – you can't grasp, you don't answer.

We stepped out after teatime to walk in the great dark brown garden.\
Over windows, like eyelashes, darkish curtains are lowered.\
Past the many white columns we went to go look at the grapevines,\
Where the glass, made of air, bathes and settles around sleeping mountains.

I observed: grapes live on in our day like an old, distant battle,\
Where curly-haired horsemen fight headlong in lines curled and ordered;\
In rocky Crimea – the art of Achaea, and here\
Are the noble and rust colored furrows of our golden acres.

Now, the silence stands still in the room that’s as white as a spindle,\
You smell vinegar, paint and the fresh and young wine from the cellar.\
Remember the old Grecian home, with everyone’s favorite wife – \
Not Helen – the other one – how long her embroidering took?

Golden fleece, after all, where are you, after all, golden fleece?\
The ponderous waves of the sea crashed and sounded all voyage.\
Taking leave of his vessel, the seas having tired its canvas, \
Odysseus returned, when with time and expanse he was full.
